## How It Works
The Unit Converter works by taking a user-provided value and a selected base unit (e.g., millimeters, centimeters, etc.). When the user clicks the **"Convert"** button, the JavaScript code calculates the equivalent value in all other supported units and displays the results in a clean, formatted layout.

### Example:
- **Input**: `10 meters`
- **Output**:
  - `10 meters is equal to 10000 mm`
  - `10 meters is equal to 1000 cm`
  - `10 meters is equal to 100 dm`
  - `10 meters is equal to 1 Dm`
  - `10 meters is equal to 0.1 hm`
  - `10 meters is equal to 0.01 km`
